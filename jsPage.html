            <p>
                JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language that is known as the three, core languages to 
                build web applications and was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich during his time at Netscape. 
                It has gained a lot of popularity over the years and has added functionality. It has allowed 
                uses to interact with the content to make the experience more enjoyable. JS works by 
                executing functions on the client side but the introduction of Node.js has enabled to be 
                executed on servers. These functions are prototype based which means it's a multiparadigm 
                language. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, imperative and functional programming 
                styles (cited from

            Computers used to be much slower and browsers and experienced lag during web browsing 
            on servers. Along with the expense of hosting files, this led most web developers to 
            believe that JavaScript was a terrible idea. JavaScript changed the definition of web 
            browsing and is executed on the user's computer when they access the page (client-side). 
            This made sites more responsive on the user end and provided less traffic and processing 
            strain on the server. Nowadays, computers are much faster and bandwidth is considered to 
            be less cheaper which negates the downsides of JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript can be used in a various scenario but is commonly utilised as a front-end web development tool. 
            Some of uses and benefits include:

            Brief History of JavaScript
        </h1>

        <p>
            The decade of 1990 was an important time for the internet to flourish. While Netscape (Netscape Navigator) and Microsoft 
            (Internet Explorer) were going head to head with their browsers, Brendan developed the scripting language, Mocha, in 10 days. 
            This immediately became known as LiveScript and later, JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript rapidly grew which meant that it needed to be correctly maintained and developed. For this, Netscape assigned an 
            organisation to standardise computing known European Computer Manufacturers Association (
                <a style="color: #1abc9c; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" 
                    target="_blank">
                    ECMA
                </a>
            ) in 1995. The ECMA specifications were labelled ECMA-262 and ECMAScript languages included JavaScript, JScript, 
            and ActionScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            These first ECMA script was released in 1997 included many specifications such as generators, iterators and destructuring assignments 
            but a year later ECMA Script (ES) 2 and 3 were introduced. ECMA3 was introduced in 2000 added features such as regular expression, 
            exception handling features and strict Boolean comparison operator ('==='). This opeator has been used to in CODVID-19 Tracker when we 
            compare the country typed to the country data in the JSON file.
        </p>

        <p>
            This quickly changed as we Jesse Garett's paper about Ajax in 2005 about how it dramatically improved user experience by allowing web pages 
            to feel easier to navigate. This paper is one of the founding backbones of the JavaScript community. The community responded with large and 
            popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as Dojo and Mootools and jQuery.
        </p>

        <p> ES4 was abandoned and ES3 was renamed to ES5 in 2009 which included features such as parsing JSON files (shown in COVID Tracker). During this 
            time, Node.js was another framework environment enabling JavaScript to be executed without a browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2015, ES6 was released but was later, renamed to ES2015. This naming pattern still exists today for latest releases of java script standard. 
            This introduced to <span>let</span> and <span>const</span> variable types which is made it easier for to track the names and values of different 
            variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, the latest script we are currently using is ES2019 released in June 2019. New features such as <span>asynchronous iterators</span>, 
            <span>asynchronous generators</span>, and new <span>regular expression</span> have been introduced. JavaScript supports a variety of frameworks 
            and is still currently being used in tech-leading companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and many more.

    <div id="App" class="main">
        <h1>COVID-19 Tracker</h1>
        <p>
            This application allows the user to input a country of their choice and outputs a visualisation regarding the 
            current pandemic situation in real time. COVID-19 Tracker is achieved using Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX) 
            and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. When the country that is typed is submitted, it makes to a request 
            to the API with this 
            <a style="color: #1abc9c; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"
                href="https://api.covid19api.com/summary"

                API
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After it makes the HTTP Request, we receive a JSON file which contains objects of each country containing the 
            corresponding data. This data is processed in JavaScript and accordingly plots the visualisations after the computation 
            is completed.
